# Left todo:

- onhover for elements to display the current element
    - We need to find all the tiles that contain this element. Repaint them. 
- see if we can have a-links that are clickable, or at least can change appearance
- 
- Figure out why we need some kind of  font_size / 1.3 to get a correct font size
- Figure out why fonts aren't loaded properly
- 
- See if we can remove all unwrap() calls
- QuadTree / R tree for rects
