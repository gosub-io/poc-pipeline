# Left todo:

- make sure some properties are send over to the paint commands.. like colors...
- alignment of images, and text
- enable wirewrames / layer functions again
- onhover for elements to display the current element
- see if we can have a-links that are clickable, or at least can change appearance
- See if we can remove all unwrap() calls
